# Testing Guide

This document describes the testing strategy, execution, and quality assurance procedures for the **Neurotrade** application.

---

## 🧩 Testing Strategy Overview

Neurotrade employs multiple testing layers to ensure high reliability, maintainability, and performance.

### ✅ Types of Tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual functions and classes in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure modules and services work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Verify complete application functionality.
- **Performance Tests**: Evaluate system responsiveness and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Running Tests

Neurotrade utilizes `pytest` for testing automation.

### ▶️ Execute Unit and Integration Tests:

Run all tests from project root:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
pytest tests/unit
pytest tests/integration
```

### 🐞 Test with Verbosity and Debugging:

To debug and view detailed output:

```bash
pytest -vv tests/unit
```

---

## 📊 Test Coverage

Code coverage is measured to ensure extensive testing of the application codebase.

### 📈 Generate Coverage Reports:

Using `pytest-cov`:

```bash
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

Generate an HTML report for better visualization:

```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html tests/
```

Review the report:

```bash
open htmlcov/index.html
```

---

## 🧹 Linting and Code Quality

Code quality checks are performed using linting tools to maintain high coding standards.

### 🛠️ Run Linting with Flake8:

```bash
flake8 src/
```

Fix common issues automatically with `autopep8`:

```bash
autopep8 --in-place --recursive src/
```

---

## ⚡ Automated Testing in CI/CD

Automated tests run on every code push to the repository using GitHub Actions.

- **CI/CD Workflow**: Ensures that all unit and integration tests pass before deployment.
- **Failure Notifications**: Receive immediate feedback in case of failed tests through GitHub Actions.

---

## 🗃️ Best Practices

- Write tests alongside code implementation (Test-Driven Development).
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage.
- Ensure test cases cover positive scenarios and critical edge cases.
